    "text": "Melting Time\nDuring the period of the pandemic things feel a bit different. Time seems to have stopped even if it is still rolling. Your body is stuck in a room but your mind is still travelling around. Feeling a bit lonely but at the same time “surrounded by yourself”. An inner self endoscopy. Exploring the actual value of life, learning how to appreciate simple things that were taken as granted even if there are not. Traveling through a nostalgic dream of the past and some hope for the future. From the “robotic” past to the adjustable present. Time feels like melting.",

    "text": "This image, is one that I've been contemplating for the last few months. It's a plate from \"Communes in the New World\", a book published in 1972, written by Liselotte and O.M. Ungers. The project was a broad sociological and architectural study of communal societies in America, from the 'founding' (in the white colonial sense) of the USA to the hippie movements of the 1970's. The yin-yang describes the beliefs which scaffolded most of those communities: a return to the balance between nature and man, and equality between all individuals.\nToday, with much of the world literally and figuratively on fire, it feels important for me to share this image and consider the future it proposes. How, in this time of isolation and distance, can we become united in our purpose? How can this image can be transformed, made real? And, if another world is truly possible, what are we willing to do and risk, personally, professionally, to achieve this future?",

    "text": "Typefaces and vernacular lettering convey a sense of ‘everyday’ familiarity through the recognisable commonalities of their forms, and their common use and reuse can cause them to trigger unexpected associations, feelings or memories. These consequences reverberate through the different contexts in which they appear, contributing layers of meaning which multiply through each encounter–both in the work of their creators and through their appropriation by others. As visual practitioners and type designers, we engage with both the accumulation and the creation of graphic readymades in our physical, virtual, literal and metaphorical movements through the environments of everyday life.",

As an illustration they produced and distributed single 12pt sorts* which appear, at first glance, to be blank but under closer inspection (and magnification) in fact display the entirety of the Lord’s Prayer, cast onto the face.\nIt seems impossible, miraculous even (certainly transcending human scale), but in fact The Lord’s Prayer Em stands testament to precision engineering—a mastery of materials and the tools which shape them.\nAs a piece of printing-type, however, it is useless. Under pressure the minute marks would never hold the ink. The simple fact that it is right-reading further evidence that it was never intended to be used, per se, but was an outcome in and of itself. And so, with workshops closed or inaccessible, and thus the metal type held in college collections up and down the country (and across the world) sitting mute in cases, I’m trying to take some solace in that fact, at least. \n*The specific typographical term for an individual piece of type.",

    "text": "For a while now I’ve been interested in designing typefaces that are inspired by human emotions and the forces that move our psyche. In my typeface Kafa (Arabic for enough), I channeled my anger towards Donald Trump’s policies in the Middle East in order to create a protest poster that I took to the demonstration in London. Last year after my dad passed away, I started another typeface called Sawad (Arabic for blackness) in which I explored my feelings of grief and loss. This poster here shows an unfinished typeface that is inspired by an Arabic song about heartbreak and the wounds of love. It draws the bleakness and agony of separation and the knives that course through a broken heart.\nThe design of the typeface is inspired by the Sudani calligraphic style and is drawn in a very organic and imperfect manner and is meant to feel raw and unpolished. The exaggerated and sharp diagonal descenders of the Waw and Reh help to create an unsettled effect. The dripping forms of the Alef are meant to reflect the pain of the quoted lyrics.",

One thing you notice when you all fonts at once are all of the little style changes that give a letterform personality.  10s of 1000s of decisions. To me type is a great vehicle for understanding the impact of aesthetic choices. A lot of differences are very subtle but if you see the same word written in different typefaces you can feel a tiny bit agitated, calm, excited or sad, and those different responses are based on tiny choices designers have made. I love talking to typographers because their work is fiddly. Coding is fiddly too. ",

    "text": "26 LETTERS & LINES is a specially curated exhibition to mark 25 years of Tara Books. It comprises a set of posters featuring lines from many of our books. These lines were chosen by the members of the Tara community and then set to type by designer Rathna Ramanathan. She worked with Oli Grotesk, a typeface designed by Shiva Nallaperumal.\nEach of the 26 posters links the chosen lines to the world around us by artfully foregrounding an alphabet. Some posters are humorous, others poignant, some crafty and others poetic.\nThe driving spirit behind the exhibition is a belief in the power and possibilities of language. As Rathna notes, 'Language shapes our identities. Words bring us together in cooperation, though, at times they can also cause wars'.\nTypography responds to the power that words hold out. It explores and embodies voice, accent, tone, rhythm, pitch and perspective. It does this in ways that can change the way we understand, communicate and engage with each other and the world.\nBy bringing together a range of reading and visual choices, 26 LETTERS & LINES celebrates our publishing vision, which draws from many professions and disciplines, and is sustained by a creative force to do good.",
